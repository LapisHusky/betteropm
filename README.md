# betteropm
OPM but without login, page replacing, or paywalls. All resources are public on this github, the script does not load anything from other websites.

To install:
- Install TamperMonkey https://www.tampermonkey.net/
- Go to https://github.com/LapisHusky/betteropm/raw/main/betteropm.user.js and click Install
- Refresh OWOP and enjoy.

This also features a better dependency loading system which works in parallel - this means everything loads significantly faster when you refresh the page.
