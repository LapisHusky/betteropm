# betteropm
OPM but without login, page replacing, or paywalls. All resources are public on this github, the script does not load anything from other websites.

To install:
- Install TamperMonkey https://www.tampermonkey.net/
- Click the `Create New Script` button within the extension's menu
- Paste everything from `betteropm.user.js` into the text area.
- Refresh OWOP and enjoy.

This also features a better dependency loading system which works in parallel - this means everything loads significantly faster when you refresh the page.
